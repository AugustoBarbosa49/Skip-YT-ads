This code is made so you can skip youtube ads automatically. All you need to do is inform where 
the code and the image are located in your PC (the "C:/Users/...") run the code and start watching 
your videos. Of course, it will not skip unskippable ads an you can't close it after you start 
runing it, or the code will just stop working. To turn it off, just drag your mouse to the 
top-left border of your screen. Hope you like it!
